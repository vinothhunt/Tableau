 There are three types of cognitive load, intrinsic, extraneous, and germane.

Intrinsic cognitive load is the amount of memory that we need to understand something.
 So if I'm adding 2 plus 2, I could do that while I'm distracted or even while I'm speaking to you right now.
 But if I have to do long division, there is no way I'm going to be able to present this material and do that
 long division at the same time. I'll need to concentrate and can't be distracted. Otherwise, it'll take a 
lot longer, or I won't be able to do it at all.

The next one is extraneous cognitive load. That is the amount of extra brain power that I need to deal with 
poorly designed visualizations. It is the ability to not only visually spot the issues but be able to describ
e them, as well. It is how information is presented, and if it is ineffective, that puts extra pressure on
 our cognitive load.

Finally, germane cognitive load is a way for the brain to look for patterns to develop context.
 As with extraneous load, it is to help take a cognitive issue and present it in an easy and meaningful way.
 We'll use these three types of cognitive loads instinctively throughout this specialization


use pre-attentive attributes in your visualization.

of memory, iconic, short-term, and long-term memory.. You can change the size, the color, orientation, shape, line, length or width, you can put in an enclosure,
 create some pre-attentive attributes using color.


Gestalt Principles.

The six principles are, one, proximity. Two, similarity. Three, enclosure. Four, closure. Five, continuity. And six, connection. 


visuli statistics 

with interactive visualizations and controls like filtering and zooming you have a lot more option.
